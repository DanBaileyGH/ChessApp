# ChessApp
Chess App - Final Year Uni Project

https://danbaileygh.github.io/ChessApp/

Contains two JavaScript chess AIs - AI 1 is a regular chess bot using minimax algorithm to determine the best move - AI 2 contains some dynamic difficulty adjustment

AI 2 will lower its search depth (look forward less moves), and occasionally "blunder" if it has too much of an advantage over the human player
